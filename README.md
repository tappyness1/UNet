# UNet

## What this is about
Just a simple implementation based on the UNet which is the convolutional neural network used in Medical Field and Denoising and hence was used by Latent Diffusion Models. Hence, pretty important and my whole impetus for trying to implement it. 

## What has been done 
Able to get the downsampling part, which admittedly is the easy part. It's upsampling part that's the problem because we're fighting against gravity or something. 

## How to run 

Make sure you change the directory of your data. I used Flowers102 dataset hence 102 classes. 

```
python -m src.main
```
